# Jenkins Pipeline for Java based application usingnpm, Argo CD, Shell Script and Kubernetes.

Here are the step-by-step details to set up an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a NodeJS application using Argo CD, Shell Script, and Kubernetes:

Prerequisites:

NodeJS application code hosted on a Git repository
Jenkins server
Kubernetes cluster
Shell Script
Argo CD

Steps:

1. Containerization

- Dockerfile
- Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js application. The container will run the web server on port 8000.

2. Continuous Integration Setup

- CI Tool: Jenkins

We will use Jenkins to automate the testing and building of the Docker image. Here are the steps to set up Jenkins:

- Install Jenkins:

Download and install Jenkins from the official website.

- Install Necessary Plugins:

Docker Pipeline Plugin
Git Plugin

- Set Up a Jenkins Pipeline:

Create a Jenkins Pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) in the root directory of your project:

3. Define and configure the pipeline stages:
    Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
    Stage 2: Build the NodeJS application using npm.
    Stage 3: Run the tests.
    Stage 4: Build the Docker image.
    Stage 5: Push the Docker image to Docker Hub. 
    Stage 6: Deploy the application to a stage environment using Helm.

4. Continuous Delivery Setup

- CD Tool: ArgoCD

Use ArgoCD to manage the deployment to the staging environment.

- Install ArgoCD:

Follow the installation guide to install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster.

- Configure ArgoCD Application:

Create an ArgoCD application configuration file (argo-app.yaml):

5. Configure Jenkins pipeline to integrate with Argo CD:
   6.1 Add the Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials.
   6.2 Update the Jenkins pipeline to include the Argo CD deployment stage.

6. Create Kubernetes Manifests:
Create Kubernetes deployment and service manifests in the manifests directory of your repository:

manifests/deployment.yaml
manifests/service.yaml:


7. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
   7.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the NodeJS application.
   7.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.

This end-to-end Jenkins pipeline will automate the entire CI/CD process for a NodeJS application, from code checkout to Stage deployment, using popular tools like Argo CD, Shell Script, and Kubernetes.
